# Curvetopia - Adobe Gensolve Hackathon 2024

Welcome to **Curvetopia**, a cutting-edge whiteboard application designed to bring order, symmetry, and beauty to the chaotic world of 2D curves. Developed as part of the Adobe Gensolve Hackathon 2024, Curvetopia is your gateway to mastering the art of curve identification, regularization, and completion in Euclidean space.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Curvetopia focuses on analyzing and manipulating 2D curves, with a strong emphasis on closed curves, symmetry detection, and curve completion. Whether you're dealing with hand-drawn shapes or complex geometric forms, Curvetopia provides the tools to regularize, classify, and beautify curves, making it an essential tool for designers, mathematicians, and digital artists alike.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Regularization of Curves**: Identify and categorize regular shapes such as lines, circles, ellipses, rectangles, polygons, and stars.
- **Symmetry Detection**: Analyze and visualize symmetry in closed curves.
- **Curve Completion**: Develop algorithms to naturally complete incomplete curves caused by occlusion or fragmentation.

## 🌟 Features

### 🔹 Regularize Curves
- **Straight Lines**: Detect and process straight lines within curve data.
- **Circles & Ellipses**: Identify curves where all points are equidistant from a center or curves with two focal points.
- **Rectangles & Rounded Rectangles**: Distinguish between sharp-edged and rounded rectangles.
- **Regular Polygons & Star Shapes**: Identify polygons with equal sides and angles, and star shapes with radial symmetry.

### 🔹 Symmetry in Curves
- Detect and fit Bézier curves to points exhibiting reflection symmetry, focusing on closed shapes.

### 🔹 Completing Incomplete Curves
- Develop algorithms for completing curves with various levels of occlusion:
  - **Fully Contained Shapes**: One shape completely inside another.
  - **Partially Contained Shapes**: Connected but partially occluded shapes.
  - **Disconnected Shapes**: Fragmented curves requiring completion.
